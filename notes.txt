--> Anguter :- it is an open source , cross platform , javascript framework which is used to develop ui (called a user interface) (frontend)
--> open source : free available 
--> cross platform : perform and working on any platform , linux , window or mac etc.
it is a javascript framework 
--> framework :- framework is basically combination of multiple library, classes and runtime envoirment. so basically framework is the combination of multiple functionality 
and advantage of these funvctionality are basically iwth the help of it we can develop our programm very easily and fastly.

--> in starting aroun 2012 anguler known as anguler js (anguler 1)
     --> we can write all the code in vanilla javascript(pure javascript code)
--> but in 2016 , it introduced anguler 2 (from there it is known as anguler only )
     --> write code in typescript (typescript is the superset of javascript) (type script support data type feature so the javascript is loosly type language 
     we cannot define data type in javascript , but with the help of typescript we can define data type and we can use interfaces generic classess , generic function)
     --> 2 to 19 version 
     --> in anguler js :- controller base approach 
     --> but in anguler :- component based approach 

-> prerequisits for anguler:
     -> typescript 
     -> software 
        -> Node js >= 20 version 
        -> vscode 


--> typescript :- typescript is the superset of javascript ,it builds on top of javascript , javascript code is executed through the browser 
in every of the browser there is javascript engine and that engine is compile the javascript code and give us the output that is the internal process.
but browser does not understand typescript , so we need to convert that typescript into javascript then that javascript run into browser
these are the thing that you shoud or must aware of this 
typescript give us platform to write some advance code and that code is covert into javascript then that code just linked with our application.
first we write a typescript code , then we compile the typescript code into plain javascript code (vanilaa javascript code) the old javascript not in es6 javascript 
using a typescript compiler (tsc).
  --> typescript :- .ts

  eg:  typescript ---.  typescript compiler  ---->  javascript 
  ---> it uses the javascript syntex guys and add additoinal features like support data types oops feature like getter setter , abstract, interfaces 
  generics .
  -- > javascript is loosly typed language while type script is strongly typed language 
--> install type script :
   npm install typescript --g (g means globaly)


--> how we run typescript program 
   --> open folder in cmd or terminal 
   --> tsc first.ts
   --> node first.js
   -->       the sum is 9 

--> typescript datatypes:-
     --> it used type annotation to specify explicit type for identifiers such as for variables , functions , objects etc.
